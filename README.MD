# Black Hole Storage
Black Hole Storage is a mod about mysterious places in our universe.
It allows player to manually create and maintain own little Black Hole.
If it would be natural, it would cause far more damage than hand-made.
Note: this mod is end-game, because it requires billions of RF to use, so you might want to take a look at Solar Flux Reborn.
To get started with the mod, make Atomic Transformer.
